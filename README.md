TQPortal for [backside-servlet-ks](https://github.com/topicquests/backside-servlet-ks "https://github.com/topicquests/backside-servlet-ks")

## Overview ##
TQPortalKS is the latest in a series of explorations in facilitating online collaboration and sense making.  The late Douglas Engelbart spoke of an ensemble composed of people, their knowledge, beliefs, aspirations, skills, and capabilities (social systems) coupled with the Information Technology (tool systems) they use to collaborate. He referred to that ensemble as a Dynamic Knowledge Repository (DKR).

Most importantly, he spoke in terms of the co-evolution processes operating on that ensemble.  He spoke of the *co-evolution of capabilities infrastructures*.

More recently, the TopicQuests Foundation, owner and co-creator of this codebase, uses a more general term: a DKR is now referred to as a *Knowledge Garden*.  A knowledge garden, in our parlance, is organized around the same principles which cause condos, supermarkets, and whole towns to grow up around golf courses.  Technically speaking, the golf course serves as an *attractor basin* for that emerging ecosystem.

In the knowledge garden framework, the attractor basin is, instead, a public digital library, one which *federates* all of the knowledge work going on in the *condos* which emerge in that ecosystem.

TQPortalKS is being crafted to serve as a prototypical condo in the garden.
